<p>I'm LaNice Powell, a mother of two that has decided to change careers and jump into software engineering.  I have been thinking long and hard about what career path would be the most beneficial and fulfilling for me and it was difficult to know which way to go.  I come from an educational background working for the Board of Education in mathematics as a teacher and tutor  Then took a step away to check out cooperate.  I quickly realized that for me to be successful I need skills that would allow me to stand out.  More credentials, I made a list and thought what career path would utilize the mathematical skill set  that I already possess, but may also offer flexibility, some creativity, and also a nice salary.   Yay coding!!?? Then I started to research coding,  had a friend that was into coding.  Joined Career Karma by accident and realized that this dream is obtainable.  Received my motivation, was able to organize study groups, and build this support system outside of Flatiron School.  As I became comfortable inside Learn.co and also started to utilize their resources, study groups, and ask a question.  Today is my day one of Flatiron school 7/15 part time cohort and I am excited to be here.  I am excited for my future, and I feel that in this short time I have been exposed to so many things that I did not know existed.  This is a whole now world for me and I am ready for it!! Lets go!!!!   </p>
